    """
    Use Induced Dimension Reduction iteration to solve A x = b.
    Parameters
    ----------
    A : {sparse matrix, dense matrix, LinearOperator}
        The real or complex N-by-N matrix of the linear system.
    b : {array, matrix}
        Right hand side of the linear system. Has shape (N,) or (N,1).
    Returns
    -------
    x : {array, matrix}
        The converged solution.
    info : integer
        Provides convergence information:
          * 0  : successful exit
          * >0 : convergence to tolerance not achieved, number of iterations
          * <0 : illegal input or breakdown
    Other parameters
    ----------------
    x0 : {array, matrix}
        Starting guess for the solution (a vector of zeros by default).
    tol : float
        Tolerance to achieve. The algorithm terminates when either the relative
        or the absolute residual is below `tol`.
    s : integer, optional
        specifies the dimension of the shadow space. Norrmally, a higher 
        s gives faster convergence, but also makes the method more expensive.
        Default is 4.
    maxiter : integer, optional
	Maximum number of iterations.  Iteration will stop after maxiter
	steps even if the specified tolerance has not been achieved.
    xtype : {'f','d','F','D'}
        This parameter is DEPRECATED --- avoid using it.
        The type of the result.  If None, then it will be determined from
        A.dtype.char and b.  If A does not have a typecode method then it
        will compute A.matvec(x0) to get a typecode.   To save the extra
        computation when A does not have a typecode attribute use xtype=0
        for the same type as b or use xtype='f','d','F',or 'D'.
        This parameter has been superseded by LinearOperator.
    M : {sparse matrix, dense matrix, LinearOperator}
        Inverse of the preconditioner of A.  M should approximate the
        inverse of A and be easy to solve for (see Notes).  Effective
        preconditioning dramatically improves the rate of convergence,
        which implies that fewer iterations are needed to reach a given
        error tolerance.  By default, no preconditioner is used.
    callback : function
        User-supplied function to call after each iteration.  It is called
        as callback(xk), where xk is the current solution vector.
